# WEBD-2008 - Web Development Two 

Web Development 2 builds upon skills learned in Web Development 1. In this course we will continue to explore the Web Development stack by working with server side code using PHP as the main language.

We will use PHP to create dynamic webpages with data derived from databases, cookies, sessions, and JSON files. You will work in groups to complete your assignments in the first half of the course.

The second half of the course will be dedicated to an individual project where you will create a working Content Management System.
